It seems rather silly to start a blog in 2023. The best time to start a blog probably would have been the halcyon days (in internet terms) of 2006, but then I suppose that would have been the best time to do anything on the internet. Does anybody read blogs anymore? I'm sure somebody does. But the greater world of personal-ish internet writing seems to have moved towards social media, newsletters (because we've all recently decided we want _more_ email?), or some sort of aggregation platform like Medium. So I'm not sure starting a blog is the most advisable thing to do.

Whatever. I've always wanted a website, a place on the web with my own domain that I control. This website is just a place to do something I've always enjoyed but don't really do that much: write. It's also an excuse to work on my coding skills and try out different things. If you want you can spend some time reading it. It's called Larry Whatever and I mean it. I might write about my thoughts on some movie or book I read. I might write about cycling, or hiking, or photography or any other hobby I don't excel at. Perhaps I write about "my coding journey" and how much I cringe at calling things a "journey". Maybe I just toss off a random musing, or nostalgic missive, or just a general random thought.

This is a spot to help frame and refine my thinking and put something out into the world. If nobody ever reads it, that's fine, though I do hope somebody will. It's not made to make a buck or garner prestige. I reserve the right to change my mind about anything I say here. I just want a space to call my own, to do what I want with. It will be frustratingly free of a niche and I plan on rambling on sometimes. Sometimes I might just post some pictures, or a pithy thought without any context. I think you get the picture.

Welcome to whatever.
