# About Larry

I'm a software engineer, writer, hiker, and former Air Force officer. I'm interested in cycling, photography, making videos, and challenging myself. I listen to too many podcasts and am trying to read more books.

I live in Colorado with my wife and dog.

This is my place to write about whatever I want. Most people tell you to have a niche. That's probably good advice. But I want a space of my own where I don't need a niche.
